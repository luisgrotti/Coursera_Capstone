# Applied Data Science Capstone - IBM

On September/19 i got the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/KK849AD8B3P4).

The certification requires you to successfully finish eight courses about *SQL*, *data visualization*, *machine learning*, *python* and *data science methodology*. The last task to get the certificate is prepare a Data Science Project in which you have to solve some *real life problem* using Data Science skills. It's also required to use the Foursquare API to reach the solution.

IBM required the Data Science Project to be presented  in a Jupyter notebook, in a PDF file and in a presentation.

This repository will hold all files submitted by me to IBM/Coursera.

Also, i stored in this repository a short notebook I coded to get used to K-Means Clustering Algorithm before starting my Data Science project.
